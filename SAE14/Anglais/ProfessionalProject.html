<p>
  My interests are
  Sport, Football, Wakeboarding, Snowboarding, my friends and my family. <br>
  I have been playing sports since I was little.
  I inherited this passion for sport from my father and my grandfather.
  This passion for sport helps me on a daily basis thanks to many qualities that I subsequently developed.
  Perseverance in a sport is similar to that of school and studies.
  When I like an area, I follow through on my projects. It’s by getting to the end of things that I’m truly satisfied.

  I became interested in programming in 4th grade following an internship in the AMOS company in Switzerland.
  My uncle also gave me his knowledge of web development.
  So I started coding on my own and from there my first website was born.
  So I chose a technology major in high school to familiarize myself with computing and programming languages.
